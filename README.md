# esp8266-hsc-4-8-15
Hack Sonoma County Presentation and example code

The demo is based off of https://github.com/marcoskirsch/nodemcu-httpserver

The changes to init.lua are in the code directory.  The changes are minor, it sets the module to act as an access point instead of connecting to a network.   This allows the demo to be stand alone and not require knowing a network ssid / password in advance.

The slides are also here.
